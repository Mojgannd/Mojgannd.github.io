abstract: Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cells are heterogeneous, major histocompatibility
  complex (MHC)-unrestricted T lymphocytes that have acquired the expression of several
  natural killer (NK) cell surface markers following the addition of interferon gamma
  (IFN-γ), OKT3 and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Treatment with CIK cells demonstrates a
  practical approach in cancer immunotherapy with limited, if any, graft versus host
  disease (GvHD) toxicity. CIK cells have been proposed and tested in many clinical
  trials in cancer patients by autologous, allogeneic or haploidentical administration.
  The possibility of combining them with speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies nivolumab and
  ipilimumab will further expand the possibility of their clinical utilization. Initially,
  phenotypic analysis was performed to explore CD3, CD4, CD56, PD-1 and CTLA-4 expression
  on CIK cells and PD-L1/PD-L2 expression on tumor cells. We further treated CIK cells
  with nivolumab and ipilimumab and measured the cytotoxicity of CIK cells cocultured
  to renal carcinoma cell lines, A-498 and Caki-2. We observed a signiﬁcant decrease
  in viability of renal cell lines after treating with CIK cells (p textless 0.0001)
  in comparison to untreated renal cell lines and anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4 treatment
  had no remarkable eﬀect on the viability of tumor cells. Using CCK-8, Precision
  Count Beads™ and Cell Trace™ violet proliferation assays, we proved signiﬁcant increased
  proliferation of CIK cells in the presence of a combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4
  antibodies compared to untreated CIK cells. The IFN-γ secretion increased signiﬁcantly
  in the presence of A-498 and combinatorial blockade of PD-1 and CTLA-4 compared
  to nivolumab or ipilimumab monotreatment (p textless 0.001). In conclusion, a combination
  of immune checkpoint inhibition with CIK cells augments cytotoxicity of CIK cells
  against renal cancer cells.
